This is a part of my work from Sept. 2021 in applied mathematics and statistics (namely in a Master 1 Statistique appliquée aux données du vivant, Université de Poitiers).

Content review :

- machine-learning : most of the basic ML algorthms (k-means, SVM, CART, QDA & LDA, linear, logistic and multinomial regression) implementations on python & R scripts.
- distributions-estimation-tests : some work on statistics & probability, parametric estimation, and numerical simulation.
- various : python scripts on differents math-related topics.
- random-matrices : work on random matrix theory.

An update date is available on the readme.md of each repository, which can also contain additional bibliography and information.
